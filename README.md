## Project Overview: Python Application Featuring Grade Calculator and Inventory Management

### Introduction
This project involves developing a Python application that includes two main functionalities: a Grade Calculator and an Inventory Management system. The application will use Tkinter for the graphical user interface, providing an intuitive and user-friendly experience. The project aims to demonstrate the practical use of Python in developing desktop applications with real-world utility.

### Objectives
1. Grade Calculator: To create a tool that helps students and educators calculate grades based on input scores, weights, and grading criteria.
2. Inventory Management System: To develop a system that allows users to track and manage inventory items, including adding, removing, and updating item information.

### Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **GUI Toolkit**: Tkinter
- **Data Storage**: CSV files

### Grade Calculator
#### Features
1. **Input Fields**: Users can enter assignment names, scores, and weights.
2. **Calculation**: Automatically calculates the weighted average and final grade based on user-defined criteria.
3. **Grade Display**: Displays the calculated grade with an option to view a detailed breakdown.
4. **Save/Load Functionality**: Allows users to save their grading data to a CSV file and load it later.

#### Implementation Details
- **Tkinter**: Used for creating input forms, buttons, and display labels.
- **Functions**: Separate functions for input validation, grade calculation, and data management.
- **Data Storage**: CSV files to store and retrieve grading data, making it easy to save and load data across sessions.

### Inventory Management System
#### Features
1. **Add Items**: Users can add new inventory items with details like name, quantity, price, and description.
2. **Update Items**: Modify existing inventory details.
3. **Delete Items**: Remove items from the inventory.
4. **View Inventory**: Display the current inventory in a tabular format.
5. **Search Functionality**: Search for specific items based on various criteria.

#### Implementation Details
- **Tkinter**: Used for creating input forms, tables, buttons, and search bars.
- **Functions**: Separate functions for adding, updating, deleting, and displaying items.
- **Data Storage**: CSV files to store inventory data, ensuring efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

### User Interface Design
- **Main Window**: The main window will have navigation buttons to switch between the Grade Calculator and Inventory Management sections.
- **Grade Calculator Interface**: Form fields for input, a calculate button, and a display area for results.
- **Inventory Management Interface**: Form fields for item details, buttons for add/update/delete actions, and a table to display inventory items.

### Development Tools
- **Python IDE**: PyCharm, VSCode, or any preferred Python integrated development environment.
- **Version Control**: Git for version control and collaboration.

### Conclusion
This Python application combines two practical functionalities into a single, easy-to-use desktop tool. The use of Tkinter ensures a responsive and visually appealing interface, while the underlying Python code provides robust functionality for grade calculation and inventory management. This project showcases the versatility of Python in developing desktop applications that can be used in educational and business settings.
